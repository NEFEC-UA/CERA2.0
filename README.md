# CERA2.0
Dear coastal managers,

This repository allocates the QGIS processing and models for the newest Coastal Erosion Risk Assessment. CERA2.0 aims to perform coastal erosion risk assessments for a medium-term horizon, over a wide range of coastal environments and scales, with considerable accuracy and efficiency. It follows closely the SPRC (Source – Pathway – Receptor – Consequence) conceptual model by evaluating risk propagation in four modules: susceptibility, value, exposure and hazard (coastal erosion).

Further details regarding the methodology and the possible application in QGIS are explained in the publication link below:

The installation of the plugin only requires to copy the folders “models” and “scripts” for your “\.qgis2\processing” folder. I also compiled an installer for CERA2.0 at the current date (3/3/2019) in the link below:

It should be noted that the model works with QGIS 2.XX.
 
I hope that this application will help in decision making and coastal management.

Best regards,
Pedro Narra
